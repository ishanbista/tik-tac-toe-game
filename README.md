# Tik-Tac-Toe-Game
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game that I made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns in placing X and O on a 3x3 grid, and the first player to get three of their marks in a row wins. It also checks for a draw condition if there is no any winner.

## Features
- Two-player game mode
- Winner check logic
- Draw check logic
- Simple and clean UI
